# TrueFit blog website

![Mockup of PoolTesting buddy on desktop, tablet and mobile](static/documentation_images/am_I_responsive.png)

[Visit the live site](https://pooltesting-buddy.onrender.com).

The purpose of this application is to help health clubs and leisure centres  keep an up to date record of all pool tests completed througout the day to day operations.

It is a very common issue in the leisure industry to lose or damage the pool test sheets as they are kept(mainly) on or nearby poolside area away from management's offices


* The Home page for first time users has a brief explanation of what the website is and a link to the login page
* All users can add pool tests once logged in.
* The 'admin' (username:admin password:1234567890) user has the adittional option of editing and deleting pool tests from the database
* All users have acces (once logged in) to a FAQ with key points on how to complete a pool test

### Design

The site uses the Materialize framework. I used Materialize's orange colour pallete as it resembles the colors produced when completing a pH test for a swimming pool with a comparitor.

#### Colours and Shades

* The site uses a dark shades of orange for the site’s header and footer, and a lighter shade for the LogIn/SignUp buttons.

* The color of the background is white and text is black to reinforce the contrast and make it easier to read for the user.

![Orange Pallette](static/documentation_images/orange_materialize.png)

* I’ve tried to use relevant Icons and animations througout the site, specially on laptop/desktop devices where the navbar icons have a drop-like animation.

* In the home page I've used materialize's Parallax to give a 'going underwater' illusion whenever the user scrolls down.

![Parallax materialize](static/documentation_images/parallax_materialize.png)


* Colours are used consistently in association with a particular type of task:

* Light orange is used on the login / signup buttons.
![Buttons on the My Routine page, coloured according to function](static/documentation_images/login_button.png)
* Light green is used on the Edit reading / Add reading buttons.
![Buttons on the My Routine page, coloured according to function](static/documentation_images/add_reading_button.png)
* Light red is used on  the Delete button which is accesible only to the admin user.
![Buttons on the My Routine page, coloured according to function](static/documentation_images/delete_button.png)



#### Typography

* The site logo uses the Lobster font [Lobster font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster) from Google Fonts. This font was selected for its high legibility and simple yet elegant design.
* All other text on the site uses the standard Materialize framework font stack, which consists of a number of simple, legible sans-serif fonts targeted at a range of different viewing devices and operating systems.

#### Imagery

* [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used throughout the site to illustrate buttons.

* The “Pool testing guide” section of the Getting Started page is illustrated with fontawesome icons as well.

* [Unsplash ](https://unsplash.com/) I used a swimming pool image used for the home page.(https://unsplash.com/photos/nq18MYhxdGs)

## Features

### User Accounts

PoolTest Buddy features a user account system whereby users can create a persistent account, accessed by username and password, and store tests associated with their account.

* Users create accounts by filling in a simple registration form.

![Registration form](static/documentation_images/sign_up_screenshot.png)

* Users sign in to their accounts by filling in a login form and sign out using a link in the navigation bar.

![Login form](static/documentation_images/login_screenshot.png)

* The application uses the Flask session object to handle user login functionality and passwords are hashed using Werkzeug helper functions.

### Pool tests Log

The core feature of PoolTest buddy is a log allowing users to record their completed pool tests. Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality is implemented for tests logs, so the admin user can add, delete and edit their records as he wishes while regular users can only add logs.

* Tests logs are added by completing a form, which is linked to from buttons on the New reading page.

![Add workout logs by filling a form](static/documentation_images/add_reading_screenshot.png)

* All test logs are listed on the home page.

![List of tests logs](static/documentation_images/readings_screenshot.png)


* When editing a log entry, the form is prepopulated with the current values of that log.

![Prepopulated edit log form](static/documentation_images/edit_reading.png)

### Pool test Management


* By design, users cannot edit or delete the pool test records, as this prevents altering of previous records which could cause issues. However, the ‘admin’ user account can add, edit or delete records. This allows the site admin to make changes to the any error a normal user might have comitted while also adding a barrier to avoid dishonest behaviour.

![Admin view of previous test](static/documentation_images/admin_edit.png)


*  When editing a test, the form is prepopulated with the current values of that routine.

![Edit test logs are prepopulated](static/documentation_images/edit_reading.png)


### FAQ

New users are adviced to visit the F.A.Q page at the home screen. The FAQ page has answers to common questions.


* The FAQ page provides answers to common questions in a collapsible accordion. Users can find detailed instructions for how to complete a test here.

## Database Design

PoolTesting buddy uses the MongoDB non-relational database. Data is divided into three collections, with the following schema:

![Datbase diagram](static/documentation_images/database_design.png)

***

## Future Features

The following features could be added in the future, given more development time:

### 1. Account Management Tools

* Helpful account management tools could be provided, such as the ability to update usernames, email addresses and passwords.
* A password recovery by email function could also be provided. The [flask-security](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Security/features.html) extension can provide this functionality, as well as some other more advanced account management tools.

### 2. Additional Log Filters

* Admin user to be able to filter the log page by date range.


### 3. Simplification of the add readings form

* Eliminating the "Combined chlorine selection option and just subtracting the Total minus the free and populating that area accordingly

### 4. Email notification to the admin when readings are outside parameters

* Admin to automatically receive an email whenever readings are outside parameters and action is needed

### 5. Code optimization and refactoring

* This was my first major project using Python and Flask, so there are a few areas where I feel the code could be made neater and more efficient.
* In particular, more helper functions could be employed to avoid repeating common tasks across the different functions.

## Testing

## Functionality testing 

 I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.


## Compatibility testing
 Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported devices in Chrome developer tools. 
 
 I tested on hardware devices such as: Ipad air with iOS, Iphone 13 mini with iOS 15.4, Macbook air with MacOS and Surface Pro with windows 10

## Issues found during site development

* ### Edit reading page not pre-populating the previously selection


![testing-issue-1](static/documentation_images/pre_populating_edit.png)

When clicking on the 'edit' button on a previously recorded pool test, I noticed that the right fields were not being selected and on some ocassions not even appearing on the select fields

> I fixed this by adding the 'value' attribute to the options tag and populating it with the correct Jinja expression to access the relevant data.



* ### Logo overflowing on small and extra small devices

> I fixed this by adding a media query which removes the logo completely by setting the display to 'none' when in small devices.

![resolved4](static/documentation_images/media_query_fix.png)


* ### Login not working.

![testing_issue_2](static/documentation_images/endpoint_non_existent.JPG)

This one was a tough one for me, as I changed the name of some of the templates, the endpoint was not being built properly as it was still pointing to non-existing pages.

> I fixed this by updating the relevant python functions with the new names of the html pages that flask was pointing to.

![resolved](assets/readme-images/counter1.png)


## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
Screenshots are presented below:


Final results:
![performance_final](static/documentation_images/light_house_testing.png)

I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 



## Code Validation
 At the end of the project I used three websites to validate my code:
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS

 ![CSS validator](static/documentation_images/css_validation.png)

 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML

 ![HTML validator](static/documentation_images/home_html_validation.png)

 * [JShint](https://jshint.com/) to test JavaScript

 ![JS validator](static/documentation_images/javascript_va;idation.png)
 
 * [Pep8](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/) to test python

### Database Setup

The project uses MongoDB, so for either local or remote deployment you'll need a properly configured database.

1. If you don't have a MongoDB account, sign up for a free account at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
2. If you don't have any clusters, create a new cluster.
3. Add a new database to your cluster with the name: **pooltesting_buddy**
4. The pooltesting_buddy database should have three collections with the following setup:

**users**
```
_id: <ObjectId>
username: <string>
name: <string>
password: <string>
```

**pool_type**
```
_id: <ObjectId>
max_batherload: <string>
type: <string>
```

**readings**
```
_id: <ObjectId>
date: <string>
time: <string>
pool_type: <string>
free_chlorine: <string>
total_chlorine: <string>
combined_chlorine: <string>
ph: <string>
water_temperature: <string>
outside_parameters: <string>
```



In order to connect to the database, you'll need to create a user and generate a MongoDB URI. 

#### Creating a Database User

1. Go to the Overview page of your cluster 
2. Click Database Access under Security in the side menu
3. Next click Add New Database User
4. Select Password as the authentication method and then enter a username and password
5. Under "Built-in role" select "Read and write to any database"
6. Click "Add User"

#### Generating a MongoDB URI

1. Go to the Overview page of your cluster
2. Click the "Connect" button
3. Select "Connect your application"
4. Make sure 'Python' is selected for the driver, then copy the URI provided in the box
5. Replace the "password" and "myFirstDatabase" parts of the URI with your database user's password and the name of your database

### Local Deployment

Follow the steps below to deploy the project locally using VSCode.

(N.B. These instructions are for deployment on a Windows system)

1. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6. Open VSCode and click File > Open Folder, then select the folder containing your local cloned repository
7. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
8. Download and install the [VSCode Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
9. In VSCode, open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows) and search for the Python: Select Interpreter. Click it, then select the version of Python you have installed.
10. Open a terminal in VSCode and enter the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:
```
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\scripts\activate
```
11. Open the command palette and search for Python: Select Interpreter again. You should see your new virtual environment. Select it.
12. In the terminal, enter the following command to install all required packages:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
13. Create a new file in your project directory called "env.py"
14. Add the following to the env.py file, replacing YOUR_MONGO_URI with your MongoDB URI, YOUR_DATABASE_NAME with your database name, and YOUR_SECRET_KEY with a suitable [secret key](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/#SECRET_KEY):
```
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "YOUR_MONGO_URI")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME")
os.environ.setdefault("ENV_DEBUG", "True")
```
15. In the terminal, type `python app.py` to run the app. A link to the locally running instance of the app should be printed in the terminal window.

### Remote Deployment

The app is currently deployed on Heroku [here](https://pooltesting-buddy.herokuapp.com/).

To deploy your own copy of the app, follow the steps below:

1. Sign up for a [Heroku account](https://www.heroku.com/).
2. Check that you have a "requirements.txt" in your app's root directory. This tells Heroku what packages are required by the app. If you've cloned the main branch, this should already be present. If it's missing or if you have added any additional packages, you can generate a requirements.txt file by running the following command from the terminal of your IDE:
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
3. Check that you have a "Procfile" in your app's root directory. This tells Heroku what kind of application you are trying to run. Again, if you've cloned the main branch, this should already be present. If it's missing, you can create a procfile by running the following command from the terminal of your IDE:
```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```
4. Check that there are no trailing blank lines at the bottom of your procfile. Delete any empty lines
5. From your Heroku dashboard, click "New", then "Create a new app"
6. Give the app a unique App name, pick the region closest to you, then click "Create App"
7. From the "Deploy" menu, select GitHub as the Deployment Method, then enter your GitHub repository details and click "Connect"
8. Open the "Settings" menu, scroll down to "Config Vars" and click "Reveal Config Vars"
9. Enter the following Config Vars, replacing YOUR_MONGO_URI with your MongoDB URI, YOUR_DATABASE_NAME with your database name, and YOUR_SECRET_KEY with a suitable [secret key](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/#SECRET_KEY):
```
IP: 0.0.0.0
PORT: 5000
SECRET_KEY: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
MONGO_URI: YOUR_MONGO_URI
MONGO_DBNAME: YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
ENV_DEBUG:
```
10. Note that ENV_DEBUG should be left blank, unless you wish to deploy the application with debug mode enabled
11. Return to the "Deploy" menu, scroll to "Automatic deploys" and click "Enable Automatic Deploys"
12. Choose your branch and then click "Deploy Branch"
13. Once the application has finished deploying, click "View" to visit the site.
